Founder Richard Pols grew up immersed in the world of inland shipping as the son of skipper Rien Pols. From an early age, he was fascinated by engineering and model building always with an uncompromising eye for detail. What began as a hobby at a small workbench has evolved into a cutting-edge 3D printing company that sets the standard for quality in model building. Today, we blend that same dedication to perfection with the latest technology and premium-grade materials. Our mission? To turn any idea into reality with a flawless finish that exceeds expectations."

              "q": "How long does a custom project take from request to delivery?",
              "a": "Every project is unique, so we can’t give a fixed final delivery date upfront. Timing depends on multiple factors: we measure onboard (location and whether the vessel is on land helps), then we match the right designer (about 1.5–2 months for detailed modeling). After your approval we print the model and, if applicable, start the assembly. Assembly typically takes 2–3 months depending on complexity."

              "q": "Why shouldn’t scale models be placed behind glass in direct sunlight?",

              "q": "I often read that a model is RC-ready—what does that mean?",

              "q": "Can you make a model of an existing vessel that’s not in your catalogue and not my property?",
              "a": "Sometimes. We can work from drawings of sister ships and photos, but details may be missing without an onboard visit. In some cases the owner may not allow reproduction. We often mediate between the vessel’s owner (or broker) and the requester—always worth asking."
            },
            {
              "q": "Do you require a deposit? How do payments work?",
              "a": "Yes. We ask 1/3 upfront at acceptance to reserve designer time and start the project. After you approve the 3D model, the second payment is due and we begin printing. When printing is finished, the third payment follows and we start assembly (if applicable)."

              "q": "What materials/tools keep printed models in top condition?",
